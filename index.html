              <h1 class="display-4">Who is Kyle?</h1>
              <p class="lead">Kyle is a man of many trades. He has always enjoyed a challenge as a way to better himself or others around him. From a young age Kyle became interested in video games, in which he generally played as a support role to help his friends to accomplish a common goal. In fact, Kyle became so engulfed in Video games and being a team player, that he broke up with his first girlfriend in grade school because she called twice during an intense game of Age of Empires II. He played games across PC, Sega, Nintendo 64, All of the Playstation consoles and Xbox Consoles. If that wasnâ€™t enough nerdiness in his life, he went to an Xbox pre-launch which showcased developer consoles as well as Alpha and Beta game builds.</p>
              <p class="lead">Outside of being a gamer, he became interested in photographer his senior year of High School. His photography hobby started racking up the credit card balances so he decided to make it into a side-gig. The side gig eventually turned into a 10-year long path of professionally photographing everything from portraits, fine art, weddings and then finally ended with product photography.  </p>
              <p class="lead">While Kyle enjoyed the life of travel and art, he decided it was time to tackle something that he always feared... being a salesman. He started to face these fears while learning photography, though he wanted to dive into sales. Amongst other sales positions that would allow him to learn the in's and out's, he decided to get into automotive sales with Mercedes-Benz in Chicago. After several years of exhausting, yet rewarding work, he decided enough was enough and it was time to look into web development and programming. What comes from here is unknown, but the journey will keep his spirits high and ambition strong!</p>
